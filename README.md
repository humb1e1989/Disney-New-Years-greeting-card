### Introduction:
>The 2D Greeting Card is made to celebrate the coming new year of 2023. It is composed of a pseudo 3D frame a welcome door and a middle picture of a castle with several fireworks exploding on its background. The pseudo-3D frame shapes a single-point perspective scene in 2D graphics to give the greeting card a somewhat 3D appearance. Additionally, by putting a curtain on the welcome door, a scene is constructed to create a theaterviewing scenes to render the atmosphere when celebrating the new year with the curtain open. Furtherly, the middle picture is inspired by Disney New Year's Eve. Thus, the castle in the picture is created by imitating Disney's classic architecture. The rising movement of the flags means ‘Keep rising up in the New Year’ and the dynamic effect of fireworks makes the New Year's atmosphere more intense. The movement of the pseudo-3D frame and the position of the viewport can be remoted by the input of the keyboard. Through adjusting the position and isometric scaling of the pseudo-3D borders, it is able to fake a sensory experience which is ‘getting closer to’ and ‘getting far from’ the single point perspective scene.
